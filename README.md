# my [neptune](https://github.com/uwu/neptune) plugins

This is a repository containing every plugin I have made for the [neptune](https://github.com/uwu/neptune) client mods.

## Discord RPC

An opinionated [arRPC](https://arrpc.openasar.dev/) only Discord RPC. (forked from toonlink's plugin)

Copy the following URL to the neptune plugin install page to install Discord RPC: `https://wont-stream.github.io/neptune-plugins/DiscordRPC`

#### Why is it [arRPC](https://arrpc.openasar.dev/) only?

Using [arRPC](https://arrpc.openasar.dev/) allows the plugin to bypass limits Discord has in place (rpc over websocket, setting custom name)
